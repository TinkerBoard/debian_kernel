Pincontrol driver for RK628.

Please refer file <devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt>
for details of the common pinctrl bindings used by client devices,
including the meaning of the phrase "pin configuration node".

Optional Pinmux properties:
--------------------------
Following properties are required if default setting of pins are required
at boot.
- pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state named per <pinctrl-binding.txt>.
- pinctrl[0...n]: Properties to contain the phandle for pinctrl states per
		<pinctrl-binding.txt>.

The pin configurations are defined as child of the pinctrl states node. Each
sub-node have following properties:

Optional properties:
-------------------
Following are optional properties defined as pinmux DT binding document
<pinctrl-bindings.txt>. Absence of properties will leave the configuration
on default.

pins			- the list of pins that properties in the node
			  apply to (either this or "group" has to be
			  specified)
group			- the group to apply the properties to, if the driver
			  supports configuration of whole groups rather than
			  individual pins (either this or "pins" has to be
			  specified)
bias-high-impedance	- high impedance mode ("third-state", "floating")
bias-pull-up		- pull up the pin
bias-pull-down		- pull down the pin
drive-strength		- sink or source at most X mA
input-schmitt-enable	- enable schmitt-trigger mode
input-schmitt-disable	- disable schmitt-trigger mode
low-power-enable	- enable low power mode
low-power-disable	- disable low power mode
output-low		- set the pin to output mode with low level
output-high		- set the pin to output mode with high level

Example:
--------
&rk628_pinctrl: pinctrl {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk628-pinctrl";
	status = "okay";

	//for function mode
	hpd_in_pins: hpd-in {
		pins = "gpio0b0";
		function = "hpd_in";
	}

	//for gpio mode
	gvi_hpd_gpio: gvi-hpd-gpio {
		pins = "gpio3b1";
		function = "gpio";
		drive-strength = <1>;
		bias-pull-up;
		slew-rate = <1>;
		low-power-enable;
		input-schmitt-enable;
		output-high;
	};
}

backlight: backlight {
	...
	interrupt-parent = <&rk628_gpio0>;
	interrupts = <RK_PA0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&hpd_in_pins>,<&gvi_hpd_gpio>;

	vbus-5v-gpios = <&rk628_gpio0 RK_PA1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
}
